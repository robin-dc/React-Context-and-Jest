## 📍 Why Learn React Context and Jest?

React Context provides a powerful way to manage global state in your applications, allowing components to access and update data without prop drilling. Understanding React Context enables developers to build more scalable and maintainable applications, as it simplifies the sharing of data between components and reduces the complexity of managing state at multiple levels. On the other hand, Jest is a widely-used testing framework that facilitates efficient and reliable testing of React components and applications. By learning Jest, developers can write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests, ensuring their code functions as expected and remains robust during refactoring or updates.
